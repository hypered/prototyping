<strong>prototype_metadata</strong>

</code></pre>
<p>The <code>metadata</code> table contains the metadata block extracted from Markdown source files. In addition of the path to the file (as the <code>source</code> column), there is a <code>type</code> column, currently fixed to <code>markdown</code> (in case some other source files contain metadata that we would want in this table). Its records are automatically inserted by <code>db.Makefile</code>.</p>
